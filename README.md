# Yahtzee-Game
Developed Yahtzee game in Java using the library Java swing.

## The Game
This is a relatively simple game to learn and involves 5 dice and 1 to 4 players. In a round, each player takes a turn. On each turn, a player rolls the dice with to get them to one of the 13 categories listed. If the first roll doesnâ€™t fulfill one of the categories, the player may choose to roll any or all of the dice again. If the second roll fails, the player may roll any or all of the dice again. By the end of the third roll, however, the player must assign the final dice configuration to one of the thirteen categories on the scorecard. If the dice configuration meets the criteria for that category, the player receives the appropriate score for that category; otherwise the score for that category is 0. Since there are thirteen categories and each category is used exactly once, a game consists of thirteen rounds. After the thirteenth round, all players will have received scores for all categories. The player with the total highest score is declared the winner.
